# Can I copy credentials and run on OSX?

Why yes, yes I can

# What does this do?

Provides a script I can curl at bootstrap.axnick.com.au to setup the rest of my
system.

# Couldn't you have just uploaded to github pages or a gist?

Yep. But I wouldn't have been able to practice my docker skills. And
bootstrap.axnick.com.au is nice and easy to remember.

# I totally want your bootstrap container?

Why?

At any rate, I keep it pushed to dockerhub at `bentheax/dotfile-bootstrap:v1`
